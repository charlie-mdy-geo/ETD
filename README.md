# Abstract <br/>
The Electronic Theses and Dissertation website is a one-stop shop for everything doctorate or master's degree need for submitting their final documents electronically.Electronic version of theses and dissertations are called ETDs. This system is kind of Education website. The ETD Guide provides step-by-step instructions, with visual examples, to help explain the universities formatting and production requirements. </br>

Students should read the guide before writing and make sure to refer to the guide throughout the writing process.&nbspUsers can search theses and dissertations of CU(MDY) by name, year, thesis title and abstract of thesis. </br>

"Report from the field" focuses on current developments in computer University (Mandalay).&nbspFor admin site, admins can insert data into databases. Users can use website with Smart phones, Tablets and Computers. The system was implemented using material design(HTML,CSS), javascript and jQuery.And we also used Firebase Hosting and Database.

# Introduction <br/>
  Nowadays, most of the people widely use internet with mobile phones, tablets and comoputers for various purposes. Around the world, students use online libraries and students can search books at every time and everywhere. It can save time and energy. <br />
  
  The purposes of our project ETD(Electronic thesis and dissertation)is to provide a good experience which will be of enduring value to the student in understanding how new knowledge is acquired and communicated within his/her chosen fields. In our projects, students can search theses with their abstracts from 2008 to 2016. <br />
  
  The aims of our project is to get easily about the thesis information of the master students in University of Computer Studies(Mandalay) at one place and to save time, to reduce paper and familiar with electronic library.<br />
  
 The project is developed in firebase for window site, mobile phone and tablet. Our project mainly focuses on basic operation in this system like inserting new data or view data. </br>
 
 Our project is very useful for students inreal world. One significant means of achieving this important mission is the education of graduate students.
 
 # Background of the system </br>
# Firebase Hosting </br>
 The production-grade web content hosted for developers is called as firebase hosting. With the help of hosting, user can quickly and easily deploy web apps or content to the CDN (Global content delivery network) using a single command. Firebase hosting gives user a fast, secure, and reliable way to host the app's static assets such as HTMl,CSS, Javascript, and media files. It is very easy process in Firebase because it contains Custom domain support, and Global CDN. Whether users are sending a simple application landing page or a complex Progress Web App. Hosting gives user the infrastructure, features, and manage static website.
# Firebase Database </br>
 A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Data gets updated, expanded and deleted as new information is added. </br>
 
  The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is syned across all clients in realtime, and remains available when the app goes offline. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When user build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and automatically receive updates with the newest data. By utilizing this feature of Firebase, there is no necessity to make the own database. Firebase handles all the components that usually come along with creating a backend for applications. It gives an adoptable, expression-based rules language to define how the data should be organized and when information can be persud from or composed to. When user point the app to the proper data source in Firebase, it will retrieve the data in real-time. 
  # Firebase Authentication </br>
 Firebase authentication is a service provided by firebase which helps you to build the user authentication system for mobile/web application. It comes with the basic lifecycle methods like Login, Logout, Singup, reset password etc. Also firebase provides an ability to easily integrate your social oauth login with a matter of few clicks.
 # Objective of the Project </br>
- To study how theses can be modified in real project.</br>
- To save time for searching via the internet. </br>
- To help students be better preparaed as knowledge workers </br>
- To gain data easily from this project. </br>
- To learn about electronic document preparation and digital libraries.</br>
# Scope of Proposed System</br>
The proposed project of Electronic  Thesis and Dissertation is prescribed as follow; </br>
- View Home </br>
- View Author </br>
- View Bachelor </br>
- View Year </br>
- View Publisher </br>
- Login Email and Password
## METHODOLOGY </br>
# Software Selection </br>
# Chosen Programming Language </br>
we would like to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, material design lite in our project because there are a lot of benefits to pick up languages in our windows form application. </br>
- HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup. </br>
- CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. </br>
- Javascript is a high-level and interrupted programming language. </br>
- JQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich Javascript library. </br>
- Material Design Lite makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. </br>
- They are readily available and easy to access. </br>
# Software Requirements </br>
- Firebase database </br>
- Sublime Text 3 </br>
- Gitbush </br>
- Github </br>
- VIM </br>
# Hardware Requirements </br>
- At least 4.0 of Android OS Version Devices (Android phones and tablets). </br>
- Internet Access </br>
- PC with Window OS


 # Conclusion </br>
 The system provides simple and complete functions for users without necessarily search in library about theses data when they are required. By using Internet they can find their required data in our website. Electronic Thesis and Dissertation (ETD) will be not only a great way for the under graduate but also the theses researcher and then one of the useful mobile or tablet or PC. </br>
 
  This system provides users to search easily University of Computer Studies (Mandalay) theses from 2008-2016 with abstract. Our project has a weakness. </br>
  
   One significant means of achieving this important mission is the education of graduate student. The thesis and dissertation should also enlarge the body of knowledge in th student's chosen field. </br>
   
   For our project future plan, we ain to do more useful site for our university. We want to make from ETD mini project to University of Computer Studies (Mandalay) e_Library.
   # Advantages of the project </br>
- Greater exposure to and avalilability of graduate research </br>
- No need to print copy and bind paper thesis; digital copies are much cheaper to produce than traditional paper bound versions </br>
- Do not need storage space in libraries </br>
- Students learn about thesis and document preparation </br>
# Disadvantanges </br>
- The cost of computers hardware and software programs can be expensive. </br>
- As mobile tablets use wireless network, they can disconnect with network if Wi-Fi fails. </br>
# Further Extensions </br>
This application has incompletes from various view-points because our university doesn't have soft copy. So, we give you abstract of thesis of our university. Various functionalities can be embedded within the project.
