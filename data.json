    "Abstract": "Today, Information Technology (IT) is rapidly improving and then large-scale availiable data and information is demanded by information socieity. To grt relevant and related information, efficient Information Reteieval (IR) system which is needed provides advanced searching facilities. To organize large information  repositories efficiently, metadata can be used. Closely related to metadata is ontology.Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse, properties of each concept descripting various feactures and attributes of the concept, and restrictions on slots. This thesis is intented to present the feactures and benefits of the IR system by applying ontology concepts and also point out how metadata is critical in supporting effictive discovery.

    "Thesis_Title": "AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION AND RECOGNITION OBJECTS FOR 2D IMAGES",
    "Abstract": "By means of images processing, the  objects contained in  a two dimensional (2D) images can be extracted object by object.The types of the objects can then be recognized or  identified. The object extraction as well as recognition is useful for many differentapplication, such as machine vision, industrial insperation tasks, pick and place operations. Extraction and Recognition of objects from 2D images has been proposed in several methods. For the extraction of the objects from 2D images, among the various extraction methods, component labeling technique is applied in this thesis. For the recognition of a certain object, template maching (historgram matching) technique is applied since the component labeling and template matching methods are simple and effective. The histograms of various objects are previously stored in the histogram database in order to be ready for histogram matching. The histogram of the object in interest as also built up by the system. This histogram has to be matched with the histograms in the histogram database. By means of the template matching technique, the type of the extracted objects has to be recognized.",

    "Thesis_Title": "INVESTIGATION OF SYNTAX ERRORS IN THE PROGRAM BY USING TOP-DOWN PARSING",
    "Abstract": "The system is based on the compiling techniques concept. A compiler accepts high levels languages program and produces object code. A compiler first  analyzes the source program and breaks it into its  constituent parts. Its then synthesizes the object prgram by using th information gathered during the analysis phase. Syntax analyzer or parser is the second part of the compiler. Parser obtains a string of tokens from lexical analyzer and verifies that string can be generated by the grammar for the source language and produce as output a syntax tree to use for the source language and produce as output a syntax tree to use for semantic analysis. The system will use he parsing techniques. The two parsing methods are top down and  button up  parsing methods. This thesis is intended to study a top down parsing method that can be applied to construct a top down parser and to check syntax errors in the program. And, this system displayed the correct and error messages for syntax errors in this program. It is implemented by using Java language.",

To make system more fault-tolerant, failover is typically an integral part of mission-critical systems that must be constantly available.\n This thesis is focused on two node failovr clustering system as active/passive model. There are two servers in the LAN which are running file servers. The cluster monitors the status of file services and network. In monitoring process, it uses heartbeat signal. If the active server fails functioning, a process called failover automatically for critical applications and data. This system can provide file transferring services with high availability .

    "Abstract": "In this thesis, a background elimination algorithm is presented for text area identification . Statistics show that a significant part of Web text information is encoded in Web images. Since Web images have special characteristics that sometimes distinguish them from other types of images , commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR)engine often fails to recognize Web images due to their special key characteristics and may contain non-text images which are the graphic regions. This thesis proposes a background elimination algorithm that aims to locate text areas\n and prepare them for ORC procedure with the best results. To perform text area identification, color reducing, binarization, connected labeling, noise canceling and pattern classifying steps are carried out. The 8-connected component algorithm is applied to the binary image in order t get individual components. The average ratio of sizes of the individual components as well as the number of change horizontally of the pixels values is the main fact and factor to identify out the text area. In this thesis , the pure text images have to be fined out and extracted from the Wed image contained both ၉ and graphic regions . MATLAB programming language is used to implement this thesis.",

The future of e-government will depend in part on the ability of governments to manage their Web sites in a more effective and efficient way to deliver value to citizens. The standard architecture (HTML) for most existing sites presents serious limitations for managing complex Web sites. A viable alternative to an HTML-based Web site is one rooted in XML. Because, it is not based on individual HTML Web pages, XML offers an innovative, long-term solution to many of the shortcomings of current Web site design tools, techniques and publication processes.\n XML (eXtensible Markup Language) quickly becomes the universal format for publishing and exchanging data on the Web. Despite that, most corporate data still resides in relational databases. This is due to the maturity of indexing, query processing and storing techniques of the relational database management systems. If XML is to serve as the medium for information exchange, then it should be possible to covert data stored in existing database systems into XML form for further processing by web-based applications. The main objective of this system is not only to use and understand the general concepts of XML technology, relational database system and XQuery technologies but also to support business online job searching application through he Internet",

The object of study in game theory is the game, which is formal\n model of an interactive situation. A game consists of a set of players, a set of moves available to those players and a specification of payoffs for each combination of strategies. There are two types of game theory: classical game theory and combinatorial game theory. In combinatorial game theory, there are two types of games: partisan game and impartial game. An impartial game is a game in which the allowable moves depend only on the position and not on which of the two-player is currently moving. Impartial games include one of the NIM game. The game of NIM typically involves two players and heaps of objects. Players alternate in making a move, by removing some objects from one of the piles, eg, at least one object, possibly the entire heap. In combinatorial game theory, there is a minimax algorithm for game solutions. Using minimax algorithm, the NIM game can be represented as game tree and used to find the optimal game solution. The aim of this system is how to play NIM game and how to search optimal decision for NIM game tree using minimax algorithm in combinatorial game theory.",

The image of University logo is acquired by means of a digital image sensor such as a digital scanner. The acquired image is stored in the bitmap file format and is color image. The quality of the image is improved by means of median filtering. The median filtered image of the University logo is extracted from background. The extracted University logo image is resized into the 32 x 32 pixel matrix. The resized image of University logo is color classified into blue, red, yellow, black and white. This is the final step of the image preprocessing stage of the system and the uniform-sized color classified image of University logo suitable for the Artificial Neural Network is achieved. The ANN of the system is composed of three layers; input, hidden and output layer. The input layer accepts the preprocessed images and the certainty values of the output layer indicate the type of the University logo. The ANN of the system is trained with back-propagation algorithm as a classifier. Matlab programming language is used to implement this system.",

The quality of the image is enhanced by means of image uiltei.ing technique. Color sensing is carried out upon the enhanced image to get the image portion containing only the identity card number. Noise canceling is performed upon the resultant binary image to remove the unwanted pixel areas. The characters and digits are segmented individually by means of horizontal and vertical Histogram projections. The individual images of printed Myanmar characters and handwritten Myanmar digits are resized into predetermined size to get uniformity. These preprocessed images are applied into the Artificial Neural Network of the system. The artificial Neural Network of the system is designed with three layers; input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The output values of the output layer are the certainty values of digits and characters. The highest certainty output value is the digit or character that is recognized by the network. After all, the digits and characters are recognized; the system identifies out the identity card number. MATLAB programming is used to implement this system.",

    "Abstract": "Multi-agent systems have emerged as one of the most important areas of research and development in information technology. A multi-agent system is composed of multiple interacting software components known as agents, which are typically capable of cooperating to solve problems that are beyond the abilities of any individual member. Multi-agent systems are important primarily because they have been found to have very wide applicability, in areas as diverse as industrial process control and electronic commerce. This system is based on the multi-agent system to estimate the cost of a specific home building. It includes slave agents that estimate the cost of a specific home type and then send to master agent. Slave agents use cost estimation methods to estimate the budget. Master agent shows the costs of the home from slaves comparatively. As in real world marketplace, this system can negotiate using reverse auction method. The primary goal of this system is to make expertise available to builders of new home who need to buy, with varieties of information quickly. The programming language for implementing this system is ASP.NET (web programming) and Microsoft SQL server 2005 (database programming).

Images can be reconstructed with high accuracy even when there are thousand of fragments and multiple images involved.\nIn this thesis, a method is proposed for reassembling two fragments. This method is based on the border distances and color information extracted from the fragments. This information is used in image reconstruction. Firstly, the feature points of the border distances of the fragments. If the border distances of the fragments are the same, next stage is to match the color of these fragments. This method is applied to reconstruct an image by combining these same border distances and color of the fragments.

    "Abstract": "The process of grouping a set of physical or abstract objects into classes of similar object is called clustering. A cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to one another within the same cluster and are dissimilar to the objects in other clusters. Document clustering is to cluster a set of text documents. Fast and high quality document clustering is a crucial task in organizing information, search engine results, enhancing web crawling, and information retrieval or filtering. Recent studies have shown that the most commonly used partitioning-based clustering algorithm, the K-means algorithm, is more suitable for large datasets. However, the K-means algorithm can generate a local optimal solution. In this thesis work, Harmony K-means (HKA) algorithm is used to avoid this shortcoming. The algorithm deals with document clustering based on harmony search optimization method that finds near global optimal clusters. In clustering documents, these documents are firstly represented as vectors. That is, the document is represented by the frequency of the words that make up the document. And then, the system uses HKA to generate solution vectors in harmony memory and calculate average distance of documents to the cluster centroids (ADDC) value for each solution. Then, the system improvises new solution and calculates ADDC value. The generated solution is replaced with a row in harmony memory if the new solution has better fitness value than those in HM.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, the need for personalized service has increased. However, personalization services must be improved to lighten user’s burden in the process of personalization and produce results that are more adaptable. As one of the most promising approaches to improve the current personalized services, recommender systems have emerged in domains such as E-commerce, digital libraries. In this work, I firstly attempted to apply a recommender system in the field of E-commerce applications. Then, I decided to build a recommender system for ladies’ wear personalization services to make it more user-friendly and user-adaptive. One of the most successful technologies for recommender system is collaborative filtering. The bottleneck in conventional collaborative filtering algorithm (such as traditional user-based algorithm) is the search for neighbors among a large user population of potential neighbors. This system uses item-based algorithm to avoid this bottleneck. The algorithm explores the relationships between items first rather than the relationship between users. Because the relationships between items are relatively static, item-based algorithms may be able to provide the same quality as the user-based collaborative filtering method and the system is implemented by using Net Beans Application and JAVA.",

    "Thesis_Title": "Comparison Of  Lighting Effects For The Visualization Of An Object Using Direct3D",
    "Abstract": "Direct3D together with the approximate real-world lighting models is a powerful professional three dimensional(3D) solution for creating the eye-catching interactive 3D presentations. So an interactive 3D scene, including the objects named TableDisk, Tablelegs and even the landscape with the sky, is designed using this low-level application programming of Microsoft Direct3D and Visual C++. This 3D scene visualization is designed to enable world-class game and interactive 3D graphics application on a computer running Microsoft Windows. In this thesis, a system is built up of a set of type of lighting and types of light sources. The system covers how to use lighting for various visualization effects and to illuminate the 3D scene, allowing the objects to look somewhat like they exist in the real world. Nature of the light in actual world is simulated by using the three types or components of light: ambient, diffuse and specular. Effects of these lighting components are then calculated using the lighting models and then results are analyzed. Comparison is done with the calculation results via the visualization effects. Not only the day light effects  but also the night scenes can be obtained from the 3D visualization by adding the various light sources.",

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol for mapping an Intemet Protocol address (IP address) to a physical machine address (MAC address) that is recognized in the local network. A table, usually called the ARP cache, is used to maintain a correlation between each MAC address and its corresponding IP address. This system controls the remote hosts over network. Network monitoring provides the information necessary for network management. It is important not only to find network trends but also locate network problems quickly. This system also manages network monitoring functions such as the remote shutdown, remote restart, remote shutdown abort, remote taskkill, remote driver list, remote system information, remote virtual memory setting (change, create, query) and remote tasklist and the remote protocol used.

    "Abstract": "Clustering is the process of grouping the data into classes or clusters so that objects within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another, but are very dissimilar to objects in other clusters, K-Means and k-Medoids algorithms are by far the most widely used method for discovering clusters in dat. This system implements the clustering of optical mineralogy by using the two partitioning methods (k-Means algorithm and k-Medoids algorithm) and then evaluates the performance of the processing time, squared-error rate and average squared-error value of these algorithms. Experiments show that these two algorithms are effective for 200 records with fourteen attributes of optical mineralogy datasets and become more and more effective as the number of clusters increases. The k-Medoids method is more robust than k-Means in the presence of noise and outliers because a medoid is less influenced by outliers or other extreme values than a mean. However, the processing time of the k-Medoids method is more costly than the k-Means method. Both methods require the user to specify k, the number of clusters. The system is implemented in Visual Studio. Net 2008 and Microsoft Access.",

    "Abstract": "This application report and its associated software demonstrate object motion system by using DC permanent magnet motor speed control. The purpose of the PC interface in control system is to provide a means for user controller to interact with the operation of the system. The user performs a portion of the weight of the object by software and dc motor performs the motion of the conveyor with required speed. The object is placed upon the conveyor manually. The user must know about the weight of the objects. LDR sensor is also required to determine the input of the parallel port that the object has located upon the conveyor or not. This system allows a user-defined positioning of the motor unit and different weight object by using PC interface. The parallel port’s output is running the speed sensing module to read the current speed measured by the total delay time. Different speed is defined as the different delay time. The delay time is also replied from the input data to the parallel port. By this way, it can be know that the speed of the DC motor is slow or medium or fast. If the delay time is short, the DC motor speed is fast. If the delay time is very long, the DC motor speed control for moving object has slow speed. If not, the DC motor speed is medium for moving conveyor.",

    "Abstract": "Recommendation system is powerful new technology for extracting additional value for a business from its user database. It helps the users to search items they want to buy from a business. Recommendation system benefits the users by enabling them to find items they like. Conversely, recommendation system helps the business by generating more sales. It is rapidly becoming an essential tool in E-commerce on the web. The most popular recommendation methods are content-based filtering and collaborative filtering method. In content-based filtering method, the items are recommended based on the past user’s preferences. So, it can recommend the new item that is similar to the user’s preference item. But it has a cold start problem for new user. In collaborative filtering method, the items are recommended based on similar users’ preferences. So, it can solve the cold start problem for new user. But it cannot recommend any new item until other similar users have not rated on it. In this thesis, recommendation system is developed based on hybrid approach. And then, hybrid approach is created by combining the content-based filtering method and collaborative filtering method. So, this system can solve the cold start problem, can recommend the new item and eliminates weaknesses found in each approach. Moreover, it can provide more accurate recommendation than other methods. By developing the recommendation system based on hybrid approach, this system enables the users to save their time and efforts to search the interested items.",

Most web structures are large, complicated and users often miss the goal of inquiry, or receive ambiguous results when users try to navigate through them. Collaborative filtering is one of the most frequently used techniques in  personalized recommendation systems. Recommender systems use ratings from users on items that have not been rated. Predictions are normally done by using the ratings of other users of the system, by learning the user preference as a function of the features of the items by collaborative filtering method. \nMemory-based collaborative filtering is used in this movie recommender system. First of all, the user has to give rating what he likes in the movie he has seen. It depends on that rating to find out the neighbors of an active user by using Pearson correlation coefficient method. To predict the movies that the active user has not seen depends on neighbors of the active user and the highest rating will be shown as recommended movie list.",

Network Management in general consists of two activities: monitoring and controlling. The monitoring part concerns obsering and analyzing the status and behavour of the managed network, and is therefore fundamental for network management. Network monitoring is a vital part of modern network infrastructure management. To monitor packet between client and server in a LAN networks, monitoring theories are needed to inform management systems about critical events. Nowadays, Information Technology(IT) is renowned and famous. At the present period of time, it is important to get more information than others quickly and accurately.

Rough set theory provides a powerful mathematical tool to deal with uncertainly and vagueness. In this thesis, using rough set approach, a more general classification system for incomplete information is presented. In incomplete decision tables, two different types of missing attribute values are interpreted as lost and ‘do not care’ conditions. In this system, attribute-value pair blocks serve as a main vehicle for computing characteristic sets, lower and upper approximations. Among three different possibilities to define lower and upper approximations, this system uses concept approximations. On the basis of the approximations, certain and possible rules are induced by using rule induction algorithm LEM2 (Learning from Examples Module, version2), and a component of LER2 (Learning from Examples based on Rough Set). Then, LERS classification method is used to classify new data. This system is implemented for mushroom data set and is intended to make a decision whether the mushroom can be edible or poisonous.",

    "Abstract": "This system is designed with the objectives to have confidentiality and security in transmission of the image-based data. An image-based data requires more effort during encryption and decryption. Encryption involves applying special mathematical algorithms and keys to transform original data into cipher code before original data are transmitted. Decryption involves the application of mathematical algorithms and keys to get back the original data from cipher code. This system applies an approach of block permutation for image encryption. In this technique, the image can be decomposed into blocks. A group of blocks is taken from the image and these blocks are permuted (that are rearranged within the image) with the user-defined key. From the results, the smaller block size should be lower for better encryption. This system is implemented using C# programming and Microsoft SQL Server 2005",

    "Abstract": "Market research focuses on assessing the preferences and choices of customers and potential consumers. Marketing managers make numerous strategic and tactical decisions in the process of identifying and satisfying customer needs. To make such decisions, they need time, money, people and other resources. Therefore, managers need survey research tools that can predict what customers will choose when faced with the variety of brands available and myriad product characteristics. The system that will be present supports the manager to know which computer brands and attributes are chosen most by using Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis. This system implements the three stages of Choice Based Conjoint Analysis to know the most chosen computer brand and attributes. Firstly, the user of the system must ask questions to the target peoples. And then, the answers data are collected as the second stage. Finally, the data collected in second stage are analyzed. This system also measures the utility of the product; therefore, manager can know how to control the stock level of the existing product and estimate the preferences of customers by using this utility value of the product. This system can analyze market survey data that have already been collected from customers. By using this system, manager can save time, money and other resources to research the preferences of customers. This system can also serve not only the manager to control stock level of the shop but also the producer to know which product should be produced more.

    "Abstract": "Mobile agent is particularly attractive in distributed information-retrieval applications. Thus, gathering and retrieving distributed information is now a widely used application. By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency. Mobile agent technology has the ability to travel from one host to another in a network. Therefore, we build mobile agent-based parallel information retrieval system in order to provide user’s desired information from distributed sites simultaneously. This system intends not only sites/shops to publish their product catalogue simultaneously according to the user’s request but also user to find the preferences shop to make his/her purchases. In this system, when the user gives the input, distributed query is processed parallel on each site by using parallel mobile agent. Then, the result which is the product information is returned to user. It not only supports activities of users but also facilitates parallel processing. The latter is important as more sites/shops can be searched in a shorter time to provide users with better choices in their decision-making. This system is implemented by using Java-based Aglet Software and Microsoft Access Database.",

    "Abstract": "The inverter circuits produce the step sine wave conventionally and is not suitable with DC-sensitive AC equipments. Hence ,it is necessary to be output of the inverter to be pure sine wave. This thesis aims  to construct a pure sine wave inverter. First of all, the input DC voltage is applied into push-pull converter circuit using center tap transformar to push-pull current alternately. The he push/pull operations are accomplished by means of switching transistors. The switching sequeces of these transistor switches is pulse width modulation (PWM).A microcontroller, PIC is used to generate this switching sequence. Alternative PWM  switching causes the output of the transformer to be high step sine waves with PWM ripples. By means of LC filtering on these ripples, the  pure sine wave is acquired. This system has to be implemented with the devices: 16F877A microcontroller, IRF540 MOSFETs, A940  and BC547 transistors, 12 to 220 transformer inductor and electrolyte capacitor.",

Stemming Algorithms are used in many applications such as Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing and many Data Mining fields. So, stemming algorithms are very useful in commercial and theoretical field. There are various stemming algorithms which differ in the way of processing, in respect of performance and accuracy. So. it is important to know which stemming algorithm is the Sest algorithm in their related application. In this thesis, the stemming in Information Retrieval are focused on. This system evaluates the effects of stemming algorithms in IR and also evaluates the result among stemming algorithms. Firstly, four IR systems with different stemming algorithms and a baseline IR is constructed without using any stemming algorithm. These IR the same indexing and searching technique. And, the system uses the same test collection which has certain documents, queries and relevant sets that are the information relation between document and query. And then, the system saves the output results of each query with systems. Then, the system evaluates the stemming algorithms with tree evaluation techniques: 1.) Average Precision at 11-Recall Point measure, 2) Average Precision at certain Document Level and 3.) age Recall at certain Document Level according to their save results relevant lists. Finally, the evaluated results of five IR systems are plotted on the araph to decide what system is the best system compared the result of baseline IR system.

This is an area that has gained significant interest over the last few years. Computer systems with this capability have a wide range of applications such as human-computer interaction, deceit detection, security, and law-enforcement.\n\tSeveral methods to recognize facial expressions in images have been given rise by many systems. This thesis presents a vision system which recognizes facial expressions and applies back-propagation neural network which partially emulates human thinking.\n\tFirst, the input face image is cropped manually to obtain only face part of the whole image. And then, the cropped image is loaded to the system. As the system is based on facial features such as eyes, eyebrows and mouth to recognize facial expressions, it uses thresholding, histogram equalization, and mathematical morphology to extract precise edges of these features. And 30 facial characteristic points are defined to describe the position and shape of three features. Facial expressions can be described by combining different action units which are specified by the basic muscle movements of the human face. This system uses six main action units as the input vectors of neural network-based expression classifier trained by back-propagation neural network to recognize.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, users use queries with spatial relationships such as in, around, east, etc. to retrieve documents related to location. Existing information retrieval (IR) systems can result in failure to find relevant  documents that refer to the place of interest because it treats locative terms in the same way as other terms. This can be overcome by using hybrid index structures: text indexing and geo-scope indexing. In this thesis, a system is developed to realize the use of text indexing and geo-scope indexing as a hybrid index structure to retrieve documents. The system allows user to create queries with three parts: textual terms, spatial relationship and locative concept. The system extracts user’s interesting textual terms from the query and indexes them. Then, spatial relation and locative concept extracted from the query are indexed by using Geographical Knowledge Base (GKB). Finally, the system intersects the resultant documents retrieved by text indexing and geo-scope indexing to achieve relevant information to the user’s location-based query.

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, there are a lot of applications that use XML as the standard to represent and exchange data on the World Wide Web (W W W). Consequently, the volume of XML data is explosively increasing: The need for efficient mechanisms of XML data management is vital. There are many different ways to store XML document. XML data can be stored in a file system, an object-oriented database system, a relational database system or an XML database system. A file system could not provide any support for querying the XML data. Object- oriented database system is not mature enough to process complex queries on large databases. In this thesis work, relational database is used for XML storage because the relational database systems are mature and scale very well, and they have the additional advantage. In order to store XML document in a relational database, there is a need to map the data available in XML into database. This system deals with the storing of student’s data written in XML format into relational database by using schema mapping and data mapping algorithm. Firstly, input XML document is parsed. Secondly, schema mapping algorithm is used to generate a document schema. Finally, data mapping algorithm is used to store all extracted information as tuples into relational tables. By using these mapping algorithms, the system can also store student data of other universities that are written in XML format and documents of other applications such as books, purchase order XML documents. This system also provides effective query from the relational database by using Standard Query Language (SQL).",

Clustering is the process of grouping a set of physical or abstract objects into classes of similar objects. A hierarchical clustering method creates a hierarchical decomposition of the given set of data objects. In this system, agglomerative hierarchical clustering is used to cluster fruits. Min-Max normalization is used to normalize fruit data. The Euclidean distance function is used to find the distance between the objects. Clusters that have the smallest distance merge into a cluster. To update distance, single linkage clustering is used. Agglomerative clustering starts with each object as a separate cluster and merges them into successively larger clusters until all of the objects are in a single cluster or until certain termination conditions are satisfied. By using this system, the user can know about fruits information quickly and less time-consuming about fruits that the user requests.

    "Abstract": "Clustering is an unsupervised learning  method: there is no target value (class label) to be predicted; the goal is finding common patterns or grouping similar examples and has a number of applications such as document archive filtering, document organization and topic detection and subject tracing. In the real world, some of the already clustered documents may not be of importance while new documents of more significance may evolve.\n        In this system, the text documents are initially clustered into k clusters by using K-means clustering and for each cluster, a statistics structure called Cluster Profile (CP) is created. The Cluster Profile cooperates with the Fading Function. The properties of Cluster Profile are additivity, updatability, and fading. Fading Function keeps an account of the time-dependent importance of the cluster.\n        Before adding the new documents, the system calls the Merge algorithm to set the k cluster according to the fading factor value and check the similarity between them. And then, the newly text document is assigned to the most similar cluster. If there is no cluster similar to the newly text document, it will delete inactive cluster and create new cluster with deleted cluster’s id and all Cluster Profiles are updated. Finally, if there are no new income documents, the fading factor value of all Cluster Profiles are calculated by using Fading Function to display the activity statuses of clusters. The system uses the clustering algorithm called Clustering n-ary Merge Algorithm (CnMA) for clustering text documents that use Cluster Profiles, Merge algorithm and Fading Function.",

    "Abstract": "This thesis explains how arithmetic coding works and gives implementation details. The usefulness of binary arithmetic coding (that is, coding with a 2-symbol alphabet) is pointed out, and the modeling issue, particularly high-order modeling for text compression is discussed. The main focus is on encoding, but the decoding process is similar. For each symbol of the file, the current interval is subdivided into subintervals, one for each possible alphabet symbol. The size of a symbol’s subinterval is proportional to the estimated probability that the symbol will be the next symbol in the file, according to the model of the input. The subinterval corresponding to the symbol that actually occurs next in the file is selected, and the new current interval is made. Enough bits are output to distinguish the final current interval from all other possible final intervals. Arithmetic coding is a method for lossless data compression. Normally, a string of characters such as the words ‘hello there’ is represented by using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code. Arithmetic coding is a form of variable-length entropy encoding that converts a string into another form that represents frequently used characters using more bits, with the goal of using fewer bits in total.",

It the companies need to continue some import products, the companies present import amount that does not over remain import amount calculated by using import allowance rule. To check the import allowance, export and import information are needed to gather. This checking process is done manually in past few decades. Nowadays, such process can be performed by using Information Technology (IT) in order to improve the process, to get more performance and to reduce the manual work and time-consuming. This thesis develops a system based on Multi-Agent technology, one of popular technology, to check the import allowance of the company. This system applies three stationary agents in three border trade areas and uses two mobile agents to gather export and import information from the export/import department of each border trade area, branches of Department of Border Trade (DOBT). Agents interact with each other using Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent defined Agent Communication Language (FIPA-ACL) and Query interaction protocol. By using this system, the user gets the result indicating whether the import is allowed or not, and saves time-consuming. This system provides the amount of previous export and import at all border trade area and the reason of allowance with detailed calculation.

    "Abstract": "Cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications which can offer genuinely secure solutions to import data.Generally,the major  advantage of symmetric ciphers is speed in encryption/decryption process but  the key distribution for application in insecure channel become a barrier.In order to solve such problem and to support for digital signature requirement ,Public Key Cryptosystems  PKC (Asymmetric ciphers)have been developed.Unfortunately,asymmetric ciphers are obviously slower than symmetric ciphers in both encryption and decryption process.So, by combining the asymmetric and symmetric ciphers, many hybrid systems have been developed to take advantages of these both technologies. In this systems,public key algorithm ELGamal and symmetric cipher LOKI will be combined together to develop the efficient digital envelope system. The mass volume of data will be encrypted by using symmetric cipher LOKI in the favor of the processing time and then the secret key used for LOKI will be encrypted by using the public key cipher ELGamal to solve the key distribution problem.",

    "Abstract": "Clustering data stream is an interesting Data Mining problem. Cluster analysis is still an active field of development. In the areas of statistics (mixture models), computer science (Data Mining, machine learning, nearest neighbor search), pattern recognition, and vector quantification, there is still a lot of work being done. This system represents development of clustering system using K-means method. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. It is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large data sets. It is also simple and fairly fast. K-Means is initialized form some random or approximate solution. Each iteration assigns each point to its nearest cluster and then poiiits belonging to the came cluster are averaged to get new cluster centroids. Each iteration successively improves cluster centroids until they become stable. This system is implemented by K-Means algorithm with Flag data set. According to the use of well known Flag data set, the algorithm has demonstrated a very good classification performance. The accuracy is tested with different k-value. Experiments will show that the algorithm is scalable in terms of both the number of clusters and the number of records.",

CBR model consists of four steps that are retrieve,reuse and retain.When a new problem is submitted, the case-based reasoner computes to retrieve similar case texts between a new case and the previous existing cases using Cosine similarity function. By adapting retrieved solutions, the reuse step determines a proposed solution, the revision step confirms the solution, and the retain step confirms the solution and the retain step can incorporate the new case into the case base.

    "Abstract": "In most digital communication systems, whenever error events occur in the transmitted messages, error correction procedure must be taken to correct these events. In some applications where a two-way communication link exists between the sender and the receiver, the receiver may inform the sender that a message has been received in error and, request a repeat of that message. An error control system in which the erroneously received messages are simply retransmitted is called Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). This is an error control technique whereby an error detection scheme is combined with requests for retransmission of erroneous data. Every block of data received is checked by using, the error detection code applied, and if the check fails, retransmission of the data is requested — this may be done repeatedly, until the data can be verified. Error detection is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver. Error correction is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original, error-free data. This system utilizes Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection and stop-and-wait ARQ technique for error correction.
